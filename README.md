# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this unit, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 


## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to build a timed quiz on Minecraft for my son that stores high scores
SO THAT he can gauge his progress compared to his peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN the User is taking a code quiz
WHEN the User clicks the start button
THEN an information box pops up telling the User about the Quiz
WHEN the User clicks Start Quiz
THEN the User is taken to the first question and a timer starts
WHEN the User answers a question
THEN the User is presented with another question
WHEN the User answers a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN the User can save their initials and score
```
